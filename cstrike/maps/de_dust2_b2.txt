Dust II B2 - Bomb/Defuse or DEATHMATCH


Counter-Terrorists: Prevent Terrorists
from bombing chemical weapon crates.
Team members must defuse any bombs 
that threaten targeted areas.

Terrorists: The Terrorist carrying the
C4 must destroy one of the chemical stash .


A tribute to this [G]old map that i've been playing for so long with my friends.

We came up with the idea after we got tired of playing dust 2 "sofundo" which is another version of Dust2 , in "sofundo"  only bomb site A is allowed.

We thought that would be a great way to remove all the entrances to bomb site A 

After doing that we started doing what we thought that would be a good rotation for the map

Meaning different entrances in order to keep the campers away 

We tested on a couple servers here in brazil and received a nice feedback from the players 

We thought would be nice if you guys that still playing in 2018 some feedback 

We are just trying to keep this game alive ,  our motivation is to reach servers to run our map for players that still enjoy the game

Again , this is just a tribute we are nothing doing this for money or recognition .

This is our first map definitely not our last . 

Enjoy;
