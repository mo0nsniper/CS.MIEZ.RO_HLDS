About Mirage
-------------
Mirage has been popular as a custom map among 
the ounter-Strike community for years. 
After Global Offensive was released, 
Valve decided to include the map as an 
official bomb defusal map.
As with all official maps, Valve updated 
the visuals and tweaked the gameplay for 
better competitive play. For instance, 
the original versions of Mirage had textures 
similar to Italy, but was later updated to 
reflect a Moroccan style.

Mission
--------
Counter-Terrorists: Prevent Terrorists
from bombing explosive crates.
Team members must defuse any bombs 
that threaten targeted areas.

Terrorists: The Terrorist carrying the
C4 must destroy one of the explosive 
crate areas.

Other Notes: There are 2 bomb targets
in the mission.
