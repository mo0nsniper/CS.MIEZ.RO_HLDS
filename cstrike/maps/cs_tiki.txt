While stumbling off trail on a hike to 
the beach-bar, four tourists discovered 
some ancient ruins.  The terrorist group 
that inhabits those ruins caught the 
tourists and have scheduled to sacrifice 
them to their Tiki spirits.

CTs:  Travel inland, locate the four 
hostages, and bring them back to shore 
(your starting location).

Ts:  No one must know of your secret 
society, those few who discover it are 
to be routinely sacrificed to your Tiki 
spirits.  Don’t let the CTs rescue your 
hostages.
