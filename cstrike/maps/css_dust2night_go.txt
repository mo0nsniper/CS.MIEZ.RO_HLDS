History
--------
Dust II (de_dust2) is a Bomb Defusal map 
featured in the Counter-Strike series. 
It is the successor to the original Dust.

Dust 2 takes place in a Middle Eastern zone.

The Counter-Terrorists have two objectives: 
to prevent the Terrorists from planting the C-4 
at either of the two chemical weapon stashes 
(Bombsites A or B), or to defuse the bomb 
after the Terrorists plant. The map appears to 
be based in the Middle East, similar to its 
predecessor Dust. Dust2 is arguably the most 
popular and played Counter-Strike map and 
perhaps the iconic map of the franchise.

Mission
--------
Counter-Terrorists: Prevent Terrorists
from bombing chemical weapon crates.
Team members must defuse any bombs 
that threaten targeted areas.

Terrorists: The Terrorist carrying the
C4 must destroy one of the chemical 
weapon stashes. 

Other Notes: There are 2 chemical 
weapon stashes in the mission.
