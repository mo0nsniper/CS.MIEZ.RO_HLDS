'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a CT was stirring, not even a GIGN;
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;

The SAS were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of carbines danced in their heads;
And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled down for a long winter's nap,

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash. 

There were fucking terrorist shit heads outside!!!


Counter-Terrorists:
-XMAS break!!! The CTs are chilling in an old mansion
 and drinking eggnog.

Terrorists:
-Destory the old mansion that the CTs are relaxing in.
