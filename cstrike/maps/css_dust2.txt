CSS_DUST2 (Bomb/Defuse)

Map created by Tatu Eugen - www.tatueugen.info

This map is a remake from de_dust2 of CS: Source game,
map is recreated with all buildings, and some stuff from css,
keep some things from original de_dust2 of CS: 1.6 ,
in some areas low computers can have low fps, 
my advice is this: step in another area or go forward.

Any ideas and bugs please report at mail adress:
contact@tatueugen.info

Counter-Terrorists: Prevent Terrorists
from bombing chemical weapon crates.
Team members must defuse any bombs 
that threaten targeted areas.

Terrorists: The Terrorist carrying the
C4 must destroy one of the chemical 
weapon stashes. 

Other Notes: There are 2 chemical 
weapon stashes in the mission.

Textures:
