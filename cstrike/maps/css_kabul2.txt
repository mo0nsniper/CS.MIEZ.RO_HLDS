css_kabul2 (Bomb/Defuse)

by Tatu Eugen (www.tatueugen.info)

A map from CS:Source, remade for CS 1.6
Original version made by 7thgraal (gralak@o2.pl)
Counter-Strike 1.5 orginal de_kabul map by Oli 
CS:Source conversion of de_kabul by Mindshifter

A good map for public servers, can be played very good.
Fun and balanced map. New towers from CS:S was added,
some things keep from original map.

Have fun!
